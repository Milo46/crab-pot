[2025-11-20T21:05:00.00Z] Even though the project isn't that big, it slowly starts to overwhelm me.
I've tried today to implement a rate limiter (with the help of the Big Brother), but of course the slop
was so big, he tried to modify the codebase on the entire width. I cannot help myself but cry on this
project as half of it is probably stolen from other people repositories, mindlessly copied by
a "Large Language Model". Today's day is the last day of this monster. I'll work myself up, starting
from the documentation, than verifying the tests are correct and finally make the ends meet and publish
the first version of this bullshit.
